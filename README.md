  ## Description
  This project was assigned during the Georgia Tech Full Stack Flex Development Program. The aim of this project was to utilize node to create a system capable of managing several employees, departments, and individual roles. I believe I have accomplished this, though with a few bugs I hope to get rid of within the coming weeks.
